# weather-application
This is a application that will retrieve the weather in the desired city of you're choosing.


My motivation behind this web application is to be able to know the weather in a desired city.

I build this weather application so that when the user is traveling they can look ahead to the city they are wanting to or planning on going to and see how the current weather is.

I learned how to use an api key to pull certain information on the weather and then apply that information to my webpage to show up as the user inputs the city of they're choice.
